  - EFS File Systems
  - SNS Topics
  - SQS Queues
  - Lambda Functions
  - CloudTrail Trails
  - Elasticsearch Domains
  - Secrets Manager
  - Redshift Clusters
  - KMS Keys

- ‚ö° Parallel scanning for maximum performance
- üìä Real-time progress tracking
- üìù Detailed JSON reports
- üîê Support for AWS profiles and regions
- üéØ Severity-based issue categorization

## Installation

```

### Command Line Options

```
OPTIONS:
    -o, --output <FILE>     Output file for JSON report
    -r, --region <REGION>   AWS region to scan [default: us-east-1]
    -p, --profile <NAME>    AWS profile to use
    -h, --help             Print help information
    -V, --version          Print version information
```

## Sample Output

```json

  }
}

## Required AWS Permissions

The tool requires read-only permissions for the services it scans. Here's a minimal IAM policy:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetEncryptionConfiguration",
                "s3:GetBucketVersioning",
                "dynamodb:DescribeTable",
                "efs:DescribeFileSystems",
                "sns:GetTopicAttributes",
                "sqs:GetQueueAttributes",
                "lambda:ListFunctions",
                "cloudtrail:DescribeTrails",
                "es:DescribeElasticsearchDomain",
                "secretsmanager:ListSecrets",
                "redshift:DescribeClusters",
                "kms:GetKeyRotationStatus"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Security Considerations

- The tool requires read-only AWS credentials
- No modifications are made to your AWS resources
- Scan results are only stored locally
- Consider the network impact when scanning large environments
- Be mindful of AWS API rate limits
